# Blueprints
At [cnvrg.io](cnvrg.io), our mission is to give data scientists and AI developers the best possible experience for data science exploration and managing sophisticated machine learning pipelines at scale.  
However, putting machine learning into use across the enterprise has been difficult due to the specialized expertise needed, as well as the orientation of machine learning tools to data science professionals. 

> AI Blueprints changes this by putting developers front and center.   

## What is Blueprints?

AI Blueprints lets developers choose from a collection of pre-built end-to-end pipelines that developers can immediately use as API endpoints or
to retrain models with their own custom data.
