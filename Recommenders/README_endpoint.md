You can use this blueprint to recommend similar items to users elements.
For using this pretrained recommender model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.
1. Click on "Use Blueprint" button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can use the "Try it Live" section with a list of users to check your model
5. You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have deployed a functioning API endpoint that can recommend similar items to users!
